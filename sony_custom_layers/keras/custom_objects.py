def custom_layers_scope(*args: dict):
    """
    Scope context manager that can be used to deserialize Keras models containing custom layers

    If a model contains custom layers only from this package:
        from sony_custom_layers.keras import custom_layers_scope
        with custom_layers_scope():
            tf.keras.models.load_model(path)

    If the model contains additional custom layers from other sources, there are two ways:
    1. Pass a list of dictionaries {layer_name: layer_object} as *args.

        with custom_layers_scope({'Op1': Op1, 'Op2': Op2}, {'Op3': Op3}):
            tf.keras.models.load_model(path)

    2. Combined with other scopes based on tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope:

        with custom_layers_scope(), another_scope():
            tf.keras.models.load_model(path)
        # or:
        with custom_layers_scope():
            with another_scope():
                tf.keras.models.load_model(path)

    Args:
        *args: a list of dictionaries for other custom layers

    Returns:
        Scope context manager

    return tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope(*args + (_custom_objects, ))

def register_layer(kls: Type) -> Type:

    _custom_objects[kls.__name__] = kls
    return kls
